A Karl Pilkington bot for reddit.

Whenever a user makes a comment that includes the phrase "glass houses", the Bot will respond with Karl's wonderful quote: "People who live in glass houses hafta answer tha door."

It's currently limited to one subreddit (that I created for testing purposes). In the future, however, I'm hoping to expand it to multiple subreddits. The goal is to have it reddit-wide.

## MVP:

- Karlbot will respond to user comments from one subreddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit)


## Post-MVP:

- Karlbot will be able to respond to user comments on multiple subreddits (r/Askreddit, r/CasualUK, r/RoomPorn, and more)

## Post-post-MVP:

- Karlbot will be featured Reddit-wide
- Multiple quotes rather than just one
